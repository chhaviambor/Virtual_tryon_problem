# Virtual_tryon_problem
We - (CODIFIERS) developed a program for virtual try-on experience of clothing. Our program works on the basis of green screen that provides client a better perspective of experiencing clothing in a more realistic way. 
This system includes an already stored input picture of any particular type of green cloth.The code will blend it with any print or pattern choosen by the user and provide with the output of the model picture wearing the cloth chosen by the user.
